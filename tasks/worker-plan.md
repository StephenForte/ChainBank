# ChainBank Worker Plan — Phases 1–4

Planner-owned. Scope: finish the application per `tasks/ChainBank_PRD_v4.md`.
Phase 0 is complete (read-only monitoring, auth, test email, cron, Render blueprint).
Phases 5–8 are explicitly out of scope for this effort.

Every worker must read `AGENTS.md` and `tasks/DECISIONS.md` before starting, and must
follow the **[commit and merge contract](#commit-and-merge-contract)** below — it
governs the branch to work in, which files may be touched, the commit convention, and
the report handed back on completion.

## Status (updated 2026-07-29)

**Waves 1–3 are all merged to `main`.** No open PRs, no stale branches. `main` is at
262 unit tests across 35 files plus 40 integration tests, with CI (format, lint,
typecheck, unit, build, audit, secret scan, migration validation) green on every PR.

| Remaining: T1.8, T1.9, T2.2, T2.4, T3.4, all of Phase 4      | not started | —                  |

**Phase 1 is functionally complete.** Two security reviews ran on the money path and
both produced fixes that shipped before merge:

- `tasks/SECURITY-REVIEW-T1.5.md` — in-flight transfers now count against the
  reserve; ambiguous submissions record non-terminal `submission_unknown`
  (migration `0003`); receipt classification requires positive evidence.
- `tasks/SECURITY-REVIEW-T1.6.md` — rate limiting now actually engages (the
  credential key was dead code at `onRequest`); `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` replaces
  blanket proxy trust so `X-Forwarded-For` cannot forge `request.ip`; the signing
  key is asserted to match the reserve-enforced treasury row; idempotency keys are
  namespaced per wallet.

**Funding is reachable but disabled.** `FUNDING_ENABLED` must stay `false` until the
runbooks in T3.4 exist — that is the §20 blocking item, not a preference.

### Next wave (all unblocked, run in parallel)

**T3.4** 🟢 runbooks — highest value, it unblocks ever enabling funding.
**T2.2** 🔴 `ensure-ready`, **T1.8** 🟢 reserve-exhaustion email, **T1.9** 🔴
concurrency tests, **T2.4** 🟢 dashboard views. Then Phase 4.

## Commit and merge contract

**Every task in the tree below carries this contract.** It is not optional and it is
not per-task boilerplate to restate — a worker prompt may add task-specific rules,
but never relaxes what follows. Each clause exists because its absence cost real
rework in an earlier wave; the parenthetical notes say which.

### 1. Branch and workspace

- **One task, one branch, one working copy.** Branch from current `origin/main`:
  `git fetch origin && git switch -c <branch> origin/main`.
- **Naming:** `feat/<task-id-lowercase>-<short-slug>` (e.g. `feat/t2.2-ensure-ready`),
  or `fix/<slug>` for defect work.
- **Never work in a checkout another worker is using.** Use a separate clone or
  `git worktree add`. (Wave 2 ran five workers in one checkout; their output landed
  as a single undifferentiated pile of uncommitted changes that had to be split into
  five PRs by hand, with two of them entangled beyond clean separation.)
- **Do not commit to `main`, and do not merge your own PR.** The operator merges.

### 2. What you may touch

Classify every file you are about to edit:

- **Owned** — files this task creates, plus files no other in-flight task lists as
  owned. Edit freely.
- **Shared** — edit only as much as the task genuinely requires, additively, and
  list every shared file you touched in your handoff. These are the ones that
  collide: `src/app/ports.ts`, `src/container.ts`, `src/api/app.ts`,
  `src/domain/errors.ts`, `src/infrastructure/db/schema.ts`,
  `test/support/funding-fakes.ts`, `README.md`, `tasks/DECISIONS.md`.
- **Off-limits without explicit instruction** — `AGENTS.md`, `tasks/ChainBank_PRD_v4.md`
  sections 1–24, `tasks/worker-plan.md`, `.github/workflows/`, `package.json`
  dependencies, and any existing `drizzle/*.sql` migration file. Adding a _new_
  migration is fine; editing a committed one is not.

Specific collision rules:

- **`tasks/DECISIONS.md`:** append your contract and your one-line decision-log
  entry at the very end of their sections. Expect a conflict on rebase and resolve
  it by **keeping both sides** — these are append-only logs, never either/or.
  (Every single rebase this project has done conflicted here.)
- **Interface contract numbers:** before claiming `C<n>`, grep the file for the
  highest existing number and take the next one. (Two workers both published a
  "C5" and one had to be renumbered during a rebase.)
- **Migrations:** run `npm run db:generate` only after rebasing onto latest `main`,
  so your migration number does not collide with one merged while you worked.
- **Never weaken a security check or an existing test to make your change pass**
  (AGENTS.md §1.5). If an existing test encodes behavior you believe is wrong,
  changing it is allowed but must be called out explicitly in the handoff with the
  reasoning. (A T1.5 test asserted `RPC_UNAVAILABLE ⇒ terminal failure`, which was
  itself the bug; the fix legitimately rewrote it — that has to be visible, not
  buried in a diff.)

### 3. Commits

- Imperative subject under ~72 characters, describing the change, not the task id.
- Body explains **why** and names the PRD user story or AGENTS.md section it
  satisfies. Security-relevant reasoning goes here, not only in the PR.
- End every commit message with:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Never commit secrets, real `.env` files, private keys, or live database URLs —
  not even in a commit you intend to amend away.
- Keep generated build output (`dist/`, `coverage/`) out of the commit.
- Multiple commits are fine; a tidy history is not worth a broken bisect. Do not
  rewrite history that has been pushed and reviewed.

### 4. Before you hand off — the gate

Run all of these from the branch, **after** a final `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`:

```bash
npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
```

Then, against a scratch database (integration tests are opt-in and CI runs them, so
a failure here is yours to find, not the operator's):

```bash
createdb chainbank_task_check
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/chainbank_task_check \
CHAINBANK_RUN_INTEGRATION=true \
  npm run db:migrate && npm run test:integration
dropdb chainbank_task_check
```

If your task adds a migration, additionally prove it applies **forward from the
previous migration**, not just to an empty database.

The rebase-then-re-run order matters: a text-clean rebase can still break the
build. (T3.3 added an `alerts` repository to the container; T1.6's test stub merged
without conflict and then failed to compile.)

Do not report success with any check skipped or failing. "Tests pass except X" is a
failed gate — say so plainly instead.

### 5. What you hand back

Open a PR against `main` with the AGENTS.md §15 body (problem and phase/user-story
reference, implementation summary, security impact, migration/configuration
changes, tests added, operational and rollback notes). Open it **ready for review,
not as a draft**, unless the work is deliberately incomplete — and if it is, say so
in the title. (Two PRs sat silently as drafts and could not be merged until the
operator noticed.)

Then reply with exactly this report and nothing padded around it:

```text
TASK:        <id and one-line description>
BRANCH:      <branch name>
PR:          <url, or "not opened — reason">
STATUS:      complete | complete-with-caveats | blocked

GATE:        format ✅/❌  lint ✅/❌  typecheck ✅/❌  build ✅/❌
             unit <n> passed  integration <n> passed  (or "not run — reason")
MIGRATION:   <none | number + verified fresh and forward>

SHARED FILES TOUCHED:
  <path> — <what changed, one line each>

CONTRACTS PUBLISHED / CHANGED:
  <C<n> name, or "none">

EXISTING TESTS MODIFIED:
  <path — what changed and why it was not a weakening, or "none">

DECISIONS NEEDED FROM OPERATOR:
  <question, or "none">

RISKS AND FOLLOW-UPS:
  <what you left undone, what a reviewer should look hardest at, or "none">
```

`complete-with-caveats` and `blocked` are respected answers. A worker that stops and
reports an unresolved security question is behaving correctly (AGENTS.md §1.7); one
that guesses and reports success is not.

## Task tree

Legend: 🔴 = strongest model (security/money/concurrency path) · 🟢 = cheaper model OK
`[deps]` = must merge first.

### Phase 1 — Treasury MVP and on-demand funding

- **T1.1** ✅ 🟢 Schema expansion + migration `[none]` — DONE (PR #2)
  `projects`, `environments`, `managed_wallets`, `funding_policies`,
  `funding_operations`, `funding_transactions`, `alerts` per PRD §13, migration `0001`.
- **T1.2** ✅ 🔴 Funding math domain `[none]` — DONE (PR #2)
  Pure `src/domain/funding/`: policy validation, top-up calculation, reserve
  calculation (contract C2). Extended in PR #8 to require `inFlightWei`.
- **T1.3** ✅ 🟢 Wallet registration + policy APIs `[T1.1, T1.2]` — DONE (PR #7)
  `POST/GET /v1/wallets`, `PATCH /v1/wallets/:id`, `PUT /v1/wallets/:id/policy`,
  Viem address validation + normalization, duplicate rejection, audit events.
- **T1.4** ✅ 🔴 Signer infrastructure `[none]` — DONE (PR #2)
  `TreasurySigner` (contract C1), fail-closed key config, chain-ID verification,
  `FUNDING_KILL_SWITCH`; monitor cron still boots with no key.
- **T1.5** ✅ 🔴 Funding dispatch engine `[T1.1, T1.4]` — DONE (PR #8)
  Contract C4/C7 state machines, idempotency before submission, per-treasury
  advisory lock (D7), nonce inside the lock, pending-tx gate, receipt tracking,
  in-flight reserve accounting, `submission_unknown` handling. DB-down ⇒ no signing.
- **T1.6** ✅ 🔴 `POST /v1/wallets/{id}/ensure-funded` `[T1.2, T1.3, T1.5]` — DONE (PR #13)
  Fresh balance reads, reserve + max-top-up re-checked under the lock, required
  idempotency key, before/target/transfer response. The destination-allowlist
  mandate was satisfied by removing the address from the dispatch contract
  entirely: `dispatchFunding` takes only `walletId` and re-resolves the row inside
  the advisory lock. Security-reviewed; see `tasks/SECURITY-REVIEW-T1.6.md`.
- **T1.7** ✅ 🟢 Funding history API + dashboard `[T1.5]` — DONE (PR #11)
  `GET /v1/funding-transactions` with filters + pagination, explorer links,
  dashboard table including failed/abandoned and `submission_unknown` rows.
- **T1.8** 🟢 Reserve-exhaustion alert email `[T1.5, T3.1, T3.2]`
  Critical email when legitimate demand is rejected for reserve; alert row dedupe.
  Template already exists (`funding-unavailable-reserve-template.ts`); this is wiring.
- **T1.9** 🔴 Concurrency integration tests `[T1.5, T1.6]`
  Parallel ensure-funded, lock expiry/crash recovery, idempotency replay,
  pending-tx dedupe. Extends the 31 integration tests already on `main`.

### Phase 2 — Projects, environments, readiness

- **T2.1** ✅ 🟢 Projects/environments APIs + scoped authz `[T1.1]` — DONE (PR #7)
  CRUD per P2-US1, `api_credential_scopes` (migration `0002`, D10),
  `authorizeScope` (contract C6), deny-by-default, disable-without-delete.
- **T2.2** 🔴 `POST /v1/environments/{id}/ensure-ready` `[T1.6, T2.1]`
  Orchestrates all startup wallets: parallel reads, serialized dispatch, per-wallet
  no-op/funded/pending/warning/blocked, overall ready/degraded/pending/blocked,
  idempotency key, concurrent-request safety.
- **T2.3** ✅ 🔴 Confirmation wait + status resume `[T1.5]` — DONE (PR #10)
  Configurable confirmations/timeout (D4), timeout ⇒ `pending`,
  `GET /v1/funding-operations/{id}` resumes tracking, replaced/reverted explicit,
  `submission_unknown` surfaced as pending with `submission-unconfirmed`
  (contract C8).
- **T2.4** 🟢 Dashboard: projects/environments/wallets/policy views `[T2.1, T1.7]`
  The dashboard now has treasury status, readiness, and funding history; project,
  environment, wallet, and policy views remain.

### Phase 3 — Treasury monitoring and email alerts

- **T3.1** ✅ 🔴 Alert state machine domain `[T1.1]` — DONE (PR #5)
  Pure `src/domain/alerts/` (contract C3), injected clock, exhaustive tests.
- **T3.2** ✅ 🟢 Email templates `[none]` — DONE (PR #6)
  Six operator templates per PRD §12.3 plus the pre-existing test message.
- **T3.3** ✅ 🔴 Treasury monitor cron alert integration `[T3.1, T3.2]` — DONE
  Cron drives transitions + sends emails, persists alert state, manual protected
  check-now stays read-only, no signing key in this process. Both halves already
  exist and tested; this is the wiring plus `ALERT_REMINDER_INTERVAL_HOURS`.
- **T3.4** 🟢 Runbooks `[T3.3]`
  All ten PRD §19 runbooks in `docs/runbooks/` (only the Phase 0 deploy one exists).
  Required before Phase 3 exit and before enabling scheduled signing.

### Phase 4 — Managed-wallet reconciliation

- **T4.1** 🔴 Reconciliation use case `[T1.5, T1.6]`
  Load enabled+eligible wallets, fresh reads, top-up below-minimum only, stop at
  reserve, run-level summary row. **Also owns:** resolving `submission_unknown` rows
  by searching the treasury's transactions at the recorded nonce (T1.5 review follow-up).
- **T4.2** 🟢 Reconciler cron entry + Render blueprint `[T4.1]`
  `src/jobs/wallet-reconciler.ts`, every-6h cron in `render.yaml`, separate signing
  secret group, pool closed on exit.
- **T4.3** 🟢 Reconciliation failure alerting `[T4.1, T3.1, T3.2]`
  Consecutive-failure threshold, affected wallets + error categories, recovery
  recorded after success. Template already exists.
- **T4.4** 🔴 Cron-vs-API concurrency e2e `[T4.2, T2.2]`
  Reconciler and ensure-ready racing the same treasury: no duplicate transfers,
  no nonce conflicts.

### Cross-cutting

- **TX.1** ✅ 🟢 CI hardening — DONE (PR #4, gitleaks token/permission fixed in PR #9)
  format, lint, typecheck, unit, build, `npm audit`, gitleaks, migration validation
  - integration tests against a Postgres service container. Actions pinned by SHA.
- **TX.2** ✅ 🟢 API hardening — DONE (Phase 0 bootstrap, corrected in PR #13)
  `@fastify/helmet`, `@fastify/cors` (deny-by-default), and `@fastify/rate-limit`
  are registered in `src/api/app.ts`. D8 was a false blocker — the dependency
  predated the plan. The T1.6 review found the rate limiter's credential key was
  dead code and proxy trust was unbounded; both are fixed.
- **TX.3** ✅ 🟢 Docs/README per phase `[rolling]` — current as of 2026-07-29
  README, PRD implementation appendix (§25), and this plan reflect merged state.
  Refresh again when T2.2 or Phase 4 lands.

## Remaining wave order

1. **Wave 4 (now):** T3.4 🟢 first — runbooks are the §20 gate on ever enabling
   funding. In parallel: T2.2 🔴, T1.8 🟢, T1.9 🔴, T2.4 🟢.
2. **Wave 5:** T4.1 → T4.2 / T4.3 → T4.4.

Merge-order caution for Wave 4: T2.2 (`ensure-ready`) and T1.9 (concurrency tests)
both build on the funding application layer; land T2.2 first so T1.9 can cover it.

Decision D6 (local chain versus mocked JSON-RPC for e2e) must be resolved before
T4.4, and ideally before T1.9.
